## Author
Yaroslav Khoruzhenko

## Application technology stack
Key frameworks and libraries which are used by this application are: `FastAPI` (main framework), `uvicorn` (ASGI web server implementation), `SQLAlchemy` (ORM approach), `SQLite` (as a DB engine)

## Local development
To run the application locally please create python a virtual envirnoment. Then, with it being activated, install all needed dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This project utilizes several tools for linting and static security checking. Run these commands in command line from your python environment to pass all checks:
```
flake8 .
mypy .
isort .
bandit .
```

## Application local run
After installing all prerequisite dependencies you could run Blog app with:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

This application is a 100% back-end one so to get some kind of UI you need use autogenerated documentation (`OpenAPI` specification) which is hosted on:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs/
```
Path could be different based on how you run uvicorn server.

## Local testing
Testing should be conducted with a usage of `pytest` with a `coverage` rate equal to `100`.
To run tests locally under the created virtual environment please execute:
```
pytest .
```
